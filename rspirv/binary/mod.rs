//! Module for SPIR-V binary processing.
//!
//! This module provides a [`Decoder`](struct.Decoder.html) and a
//! [`Parser`](struct.Parser.html):
//!
//! * The decoder is a low-level binary processing tool; it has no knowlege
//!   of the SPIR-V grammar. It only serves SPIR-V word requests.
//! * The parser is a high-level binary processing tool; it has knowledge
//!   of the SPIR-V grammar. It works with the
//!   [`Consumer`](trait.Consumer.html) to process a SPIR-V binary on the
//!   instruction level.
